# pymuLP
 A linear programming framework written by myself.

A linear programming framework, where you can enter equations, writing .lp files and solve the optimization problems via CBC solver using the constructed .lp file and read back the results.
This is a hobby project in my spare time because i like linear programming and want to know how such frameworks work under the hood.
